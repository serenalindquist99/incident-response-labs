Post-incident reports and SOPs from simulated lab environments.
# Incident Response Labs

This repository contains hands-on practice documentation for incident response processes, post-incident reporting, and standard operating procedures (SOPs). It is designed to simulate real-world scenarios and build documentation skills required in cybersecurity operations.

## 📁 Contents

- `sample_report.md`: Post-incident write-up from a simulated brute-force attack.
- `sop.md`: A basic SOP for detecting and responding to brute-force login attempts.

## 🧠 Skills Practiced

- Incident detection logic
- Writing post-incident summaries
- Creating repeatable investigation workflows (SOPs)
- Documentation for technical and non-technical audiences

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Markdown
- Simulated log analysis
- Python (in supporting projects)

## 📌 Purpose

These materials demonstrate the ability to document, triage, and summarize security incidents in a structured and repeatable format — a key responsibility for SOC Analysts and IR team members.
